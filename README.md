## Technical Implementation

### Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import plotly.offline as pyo
```

### Key Code Snippets

#### Data Cleaning
```python
# Remove special characters
chars_to_remove = ['+', ',', '$']
cols_to_clean = ['Installs', 'Price']

for col in cols_to_clean:
    for char in chars_to_remove:
        apps[col] = apps[col].apply(lambda x: x.replace(char,''))

# Convert to numeric
apps['Installs'] = apps['Installs'].astype(float)
apps['Price'] = apps['Price'].astype(float)
```

#### Visualization
```python
# Category distribution
data = [go.Bar(
    x = num_apps_in_category.index,
    y = num_apps_in_category.values,
)]
plotly.offline.iplot(data)

# Rating distribution
data = [go.Histogram(x = apps['Rating'])]
plotly.offline.iplot({'data': data, 'layout': layout})
```

#### Sentiment Analysis
```python
# Merge app data with reviews
merged_df = apps.merge(reviews_df)
merged_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=['Sentiment', 'Review'])

# Sentiment comparison
sns.boxplot(x=merged_df['Type'], y=merged_df['Sentiment_Polarity'])
```
